description: Run the playlist builder with the example playlist to test the setup
---

Run the Spotify playlist builder using the example playlist file (playlists/kraftwerk-dm-cure.json) to verify that everything is working correctly.

Steps:
1. Check that the virtual environment is activated
2. Verify credentials are available (either .env or 1Password)
3. Execute the script with the example playlist
4. Show me the output and report any errors

If the user needs to provide their Spotify username, ask for it before running.

Use the default credential source (.env) unless the user specifies otherwise.
