description: Create a new playlist JSON template in the playlists/ directory
---

Help me create a new playlist JSON file in the playlists/ directory.

Steps:
1. Ask the user for:
   - Playlist name
   - Description (optional)
   - Initial tracks (if they want to add some now, or leave empty)

2. Generate a properly formatted JSON file with:
   - Descriptive filename (kebab-case, e.g., "summer-vibes-2024.json")
   - The structure: `{"name": "...", "description": "...", "tracks": [...]}`
   - If tracks are provided, format them as: `{"artist": "Artist Name", "track": "Track Name"}`

3. Save the file to the playlists/ directory

4. Show the user the file path and confirm it's ready to use

Make sure the JSON is properly formatted and follows the existing pattern in playlists/kraftwerk-dm-cure.json.
