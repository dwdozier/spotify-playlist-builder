# Visual Identity: "The Digital Automat"

Vibomat's design language is inspired by the mid-century Automat and the Art Deco period
(1920s-1950s). It blends a retro-mechanical aesthetic with modern, high-performance web
technologies.

## Core Design Principles

- **Modern Performance, Retro Feel:** Utilize the efficiency of React, TanStack, and Tailwind CSS to
    deliver a snappy experience that looks like a high-end vintage machine.
- **Geometric Elegance:** Use Art Deco-inspired patterns, borders, and dividers. Lean into strong
    vertical and horizontal lines.
- **Materiality:** The UI should feel substantial, using shadows and gradients to suggest tactile
    surfaces like brushed metal, polished wood, or bakelite.

## Color Palette

- **Primary:** Deep Charcoal or Navy for backgrounds.
- **Accent:** Gold, Brass, or Teal for highlights and active states.
- **Surface:** Cream or parchment-colored text for a softer contrast than pure white.

## Voice and Tone: "The Reliable Relay"

The voice of Vibomat is nostalgic, formal yet helpful, and deeply rooted in its thematic metaphor.

### Thematic Terminology

| Standard Term | Vibomat Term |
| :--- | :--- |
| Users | Citizens |
| Playlists | Archives |
| Service Connections | Relays |
| Identity Links | Nodes |

## UX Guidelines

- **Balanced Terminology:** Use thematic terms (Citizens, Relays) for high-level concepts and
    navigation, but ensure functional actions (Log In, Delete, Search) remain clear and unambiguous
    for the user.
- **Tactile Feedback:** Use transitions and hover states that mimic the physical feedback of a
    mechanical automat (e.g., sliding panels, clicking buttons).
